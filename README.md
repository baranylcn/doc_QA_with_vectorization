# Question-Answering with Document Vectorization

This project aims to provide a simple method for querying documents and obtaining answers using document vectorization techniques. By leveraging tools from the LangChain community, specifically the TextLoader and VectorstoreIndexCreator modules, this project allows users to index text documents and query them for relevant information.

## Example

Suppose you have a document titled `example_document.txt` containing information about natural language processing. You can use the `query_with_doc` function to ask questions about this document, such as "What are some common NLP techniques?" or "Who are the key figures in the field of NLP?"

## Note

This project relies on the LangChain community tools for document loading and vectorization. Make sure to adhere to their usage guidelines and documentation.
